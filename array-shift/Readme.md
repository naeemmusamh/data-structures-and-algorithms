# shift an Array

insert and shift an array in middle an index

## Challenge

Write a function which takes in an array and the value to be added to the middle of the array index

## Approach & Efficiency

1. make new variable and this variable take an array.

2. make anther variable and this variable take the Mth.ceil to up to the next largest number from the length of the array to calculate the the middle of the array

3. make for loop and else if statement to push the value of the number you want to push in the middle of the array

# array binary

search in a sorted 1D array

## Challenge

Write a function which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. make two variable and this variable min and max number you want to check the target number.

2. make anther variable and this variable take the math .floor() returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

3. make for loop and else if statement to check the number in the array if it exist and return the length in the array or return -1.
