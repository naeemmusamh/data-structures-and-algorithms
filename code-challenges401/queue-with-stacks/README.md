# Stack and Queue

let's say we have multiple values and this value inside something call (node) and this node have a relation between it and it Connected with each other.

there is two way to insert in deferent way :

1. stack :

the amount of data must be specified at the last, mean it will add every new node or value in the end of the array like =====>  4 3 2 1

2. queue :

the amount of data must be specified at the beginning, mean it will add every new node or value in the start of the array like =====> 1 2 3 4
