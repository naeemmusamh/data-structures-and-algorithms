# Singly Linked List

let's say we have multiple values and this value inside something call (node) and this node have a relation between it and it Connected with each other.
so we will search for some value and look if it exist inside in this node.



## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere.

toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
