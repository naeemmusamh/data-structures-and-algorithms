# Singly Linked List

let's say we have multiple values and this value inside something call (node) and this node have a relation between it and it Connected with each other.

## Challenge

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
