# Stack and Queue

let's say we have multiple values and this value inside something call (node) and this node have a relation between it and it Connected with each other.

there is two way to insert in deferent way :

1. stack :

the amount of data must be specified at the last, mean it will add every new node or value in the end of the array like =====>  4 3 2 1

2. queue :

the amount of data must be specified at the beginning, mean it will add every new node or value in the start of the array like =====> 1 2 3 4 

## Challenge

1. Create a Stack class that has a top property.

2. Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.

3. Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.

4. Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

5. Create a Queue class that has a front property.

6. Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue.

7. Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.

8. Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
